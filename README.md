## A simple RESTAPI built using NestJS, Prisma and PostgreSQL with e2e testing using pactum.
This was adapted from an introductory course to NestJS. The major purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with the Prisma ORM, how to use docker and also on how to use pactum in writing e2e testing. The project furthered solidified my understanding of NestJS.
